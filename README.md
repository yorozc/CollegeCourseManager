# CollegeCourseManager
A python program that makes it easier to see which classes you need to complete your major or General Ed

OBJ

- will display classes needed to complete major/graduate
- classes will have to be made in a csv file (after completing initial project, I will try to find a way to get class information automatically)
- mainly used to keep better track of classes since the software my college uses can be a little janky
  
## Features
  
- remove classes that have been completed and move them into a completed list
- display classes that are needed to graduate along with pre reqs and  how many credits they are going to be
- can insert grades for each completed class to calculate gpa
- check which requirements are needed to be completed and which classes are available for that requirement
  - it will check for general ed requirement and major requirement
